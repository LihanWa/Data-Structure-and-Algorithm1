# CS 445 Recitation 4: Algorithm Analysis

## Introduction

In this recitation, you will practice analyzing the runtime of algorithms by
completing several algorithm analysis exercises. In earlier classes you focused
on how you *could* solve problems, but in lecture you’ve seen that the
implementation of an algorithm can result in different worst-case runtimes.
These exercises will allow you to practice evaluating the runtime of several
different algorithms and to begin considering how a problem *should* be solved
rather than how it *could* be solved.

## Exercise

Detailed questions and instructions are given in `app/src/main/java/`. Please
read the comments very carefully in the Java file, or your answer won’t pass the
autograder.

   - `Analysis.java` contains the given exercises and instructions on
     formatting.
   - `AnalysisTest.java` contains tests cases for Questions 1, 3a, and 4a.

You can run the provided tests automatically using `./gradlew test` to make sure
these answers are in the correct format. (Not all answers are checked!) Follow
along with your TA and fill in the solutions after ensuring you understand the
material thoroughly.

## Conclusion

Algorithm analysis will continue to be a very important tool in this course and
in elsewhere in your CS career. Make sure you get your questions answered so you
can clear up any misconceptions early!
